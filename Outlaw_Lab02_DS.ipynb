        "There is a fundamental difference between variables like `age` and `fare`, which can be measured on a numeric scale, and variables like `sex` and `home.dest`, which cannot. \n",
        "\n",
        "Variables that can be measured on a numeric scale are called **quantitative variables**. Just because a variable happens to contain numbers does not necessarily make it \"quantitative\". For example, consider the variable `survived` in the Titanic data set. Each passenger either survived or didn't. This data set happens to use 1 for \"survived\" and 0 for \"died\", but these numbers do not reflect an underlying numeric scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables that are not quantitative but take on a limited set of values are called **nominal or categorical variables**. For example, the variable `sex` takes on one of two possible values (\"female\" or \"male\"), so it is a categorical variable. So is the variable `home.dest`, which takes on a larger, but still limited, set of values. We call each possible value of a categorical variable a \"category\". Although categories are usually non-numeric (as in the case of `sex` and `home.dest`), they are sometimes numeric. For example, the variable `survived` in the Titanic data set is a categorical variable with two categories (1 if the passenger survived, 0 if they didn't), even though those values are numbers. With a categorical variable, one common analysis question is, \"How many observations are there in each category?\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Some variables do not fit neatly into either category. For example, the variable `name` in the Titanic data set is obviously not quantitative, but it is not categorical either because it does not take on a limited set of values. Generally speaking, every passenger will have a different name (the two James Kellys notwithstanding), so it does not make sense to analyze the frequencies of different names, as one might do with a categorical variable. We will group variables like `name`, that are neither quantitative nor categorical, into an \"other\" category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every variable can be classified into one of these three **types**: quantitative, categorical, or other. The type of the variable often dictates the kind of analysis we do and the kind of visualizations we make, as we will see later in this chapter. \n",
        "\n",
        "`pandas` tries to infer the type of each variable automatically. If every value in a column (except for missing values) can be cast to a number, then `pandas` will treat that variable as quantitative. Otherwise, the variable is treated as categorical. To see the type that Pandas inferred for a variable, simply select that variable using the methods above and look for its `dtype`. A `dtype` of `float64` or `int64` indicates that the variable is quantitative.  For example, the `age` variable above had a `dtype` of `float64`, so it is quantitative. On the other hand, if we look at the `sex` variable,"
