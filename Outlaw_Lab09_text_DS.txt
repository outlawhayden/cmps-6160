I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

SQL - Structured Query Language

ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram
	- Visual representation of all relavant tables with a database
	- Name, list of column names(left), list of data types(red)
	- Gold key indicates that it is primary key of table
	- Blue arrow indecates that it is the foreign key of the corresponding table

Queries -	
	- Statements we construct to get data from the database
	- If you want all data for each row in table, use '*' after SELECT
	- DISTINCT returns distinct possibilities in table
	- Can contain keywords, column names, table names, wildcard characters (*, %, etc.,), functions, filter criteria, etc.,

Keywords
	- Used to specify actions in queries
	- Not technically case sensitive, but capitalize them anyways
	- SELECT
		- Grab data for specific columns in database
		- SELECT * is select all columns
		- use column names after SELECT and use commas to separate
	- FROM
		- Allows us to specify which tables we care about
		- Select multiple tables as a list afterwards, separate with commas
	- WHERE
		- Filter results by specific criteria
	- AND
		- Strings together multiple filtering criteria all at same time
	- OR
		- Strings together multiple criteria where at least one must be true
	- LIKE
		- Used with wildcards (%, _)
	- BETWEEN/AND
		- Used to specify ranges
	- UPPER()/LOWER()
		- Case sensitive
		- Smooths text into upper or lower case

Aggregate Functions
	- COUNT
		- Number of column values
	- AVG
		- Average of specified column values
	- SUM
		- Sum of specified column values
	- MIN
		- Min of specified column values
	- MAX
		- Max of specified column values
	- ORDER BY
		- Orders data by column value
		- Takes in ASC, DESC
Joins
	- INNNER, OUTER, LEFT, and RIGHT
	- This program only uses INNER
	JOIN table1 
	ON table1.id = table2.id
